    Write a test that reveals the bug.

    1. Call `sum` with some numbers
    2. Define an expected value
    3. Compare the result of `sum` with the expected value.
       If it doesn't return the correct answer, throw a helpful error message

    You can run the code with `node 1.todo.js`
    Make sure you are in the right directory!
